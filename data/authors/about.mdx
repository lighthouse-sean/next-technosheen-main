I am currently a Software Engineer at [Lighthouse Creative Group](https://lhchq.com/). 
I architect, implement, maintain and provide support for custom web applications for large-scale
enterprise clients; using Adobe Experience Manager, Hubspot, Wordpress, and more.

When I'm not in front of a computer screen, I can be found rollerblading, spoiling my French bulldog Coco, or binging episodes of Forensic Files.
